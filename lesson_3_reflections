When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 	 When more than one person is working on the same project, all the work should be online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When we are designing something for experimental and research purposes, we might not want that changes in the original or github version, so the syncing should be manual.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Clones are a copy of a repository, Forks are also like repository but it allows us to directly clone the repo to our account server and can be linked to original one.
