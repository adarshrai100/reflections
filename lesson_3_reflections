When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 	 When more than one person is working on the same project, all the work should be online.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When we are designing something for experimental and research purposes, we might not want that changes in the original or github version, so the syncing should be manual.
